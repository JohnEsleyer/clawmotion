# ClawStudio

ClawStudio is the visual takeover UI for ClawMotion projects.

## Start from your workspace

Use the root CLI from any directory:

```bash
cmotion studio
```

The directory where you run the command is exposed as the Studio workspace, and imported assets are copied to:

```text
<workspace>/assets
```

## AI assistant models (Puter.js)

The Helper panel uses Puter.js with free Qwen-family models (no API key required).
